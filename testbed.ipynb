       "  'abstract': 'Open-set recognition and adversarial defense study two key aspects of deep learning that are vital for real-world deployment. The objective of open-set recognition is to identify samples from open-set classes during testing, while adversarial defense aims to defend the network against images with imperceptible adversarial perturbations. In this paper, we show that open-set recognition systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, we show that adversarial defense mechanisms trained on known classes do not generalize well to open-set samples. Motivated by this observation, we emphasize the need of an Open-Set Adversarial Defense (OSAD) mechanism. This paper proposes an Open-Set Defense Network (OSDN) as a solution to the OSAD problem. The proposed network uses an encoder with feature-denoising layers coupled with a classifier to learn a noise-free latent feature representation. Two techniques are employed to obtain an informative latent feature space with the objective of improving open-set performance. First, a decoder is used to ensure that clean images can be reconstructed from the obtained latent features. Then, self-supervision is used to ensure that the latent features are informative enough to carry out an auxiliary task. We introduce a testing protocol to evaluate OSAD performance and show the effectiveness of the proposed method in multiple object classification datasets. The implementation code of the proposed method is available at: https://github.com/rshaojimmy/ECCV2020-OSAD.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The adversarial vulnerability of deep networks has spurred the interest of researchers worldwide. Unsurprisingly, like images, adversarial examples also translate to time-series data as they are an inherent weakness of the model itself rather than the modality. Several attempts have been made to defend against these adversarial attacks, particularly for the visual modality. In this paper, we perform detailed benchmarking of well-proven adversarial defense methodologies on time-series data. We restrict ourselves to the $L_{\\\\infty}$ threat model. We also explore the trade-off between smoothness and clean accuracy for regularization-based defenses to better understand the trade-offs that they offer. Our analysis shows that the explored adversarial defenses offer robustness against both strong white-box as well as black-box attacks. This paves the way for future research in the direction of adversarial attacks and defenses, particularly for time-series data.',\n",

In this work, we investigate the potential effect defense techniques have on the geometry of the likelihood landscape - likelihood of the input images under the trained model. We first propose a way to visualize the likelihood landscape leveraging an energy-based model interpretation of discriminative classifiers. Then we introduce a measure to quantify the flatness of the likelihood landscape. We observe that a subset of adversarial defense techniques results in a similar effect of flattening the likelihood landscape. We further explore directly regularizing towards a flat landscape for adversarial robustness.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Deep neural networks are being widely deployed for many critical tasks due to their high classification accuracy. In many cases, pre-trained models are sourced from vendors who may have disrupted the training pipeline to insert Trojan behaviors into the models. These malicious behaviors can be triggered at the adversary's will and hence, cause a serious threat to the widespread deployment of deep models. We propose a method to verify if a pre-trained model is Trojaned or benign. Our method captures fingerprints of neural networks in the form of adversarial perturbations learned from the network gradients. Inserting backdoors into a network alters its decision boundaries which are effectively encoded in their adversarial perturbations. We train a two stream network for Trojan detection from its global ($L_\\\\infty$ and $L_2$ bounded) perturbations and the localized region of high energy within each perturbation. The former encodes decision boundaries of the network and latter encodes the unknown trigger shape. We also propose an anomaly detection method to identify the target class in a Trojaned network. Our methods are invariant to the trigger type, trigger size, training data and network architecture. We evaluate our methods on MNIST, NIST-Round0 and NIST-Round1 datasets, with up to 1,000 pre-trained models making this the largest study to date on Trojaned network detection, and achieve over 92\\\\% detection accuracy to set the new state-of-the-art.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) can easily be fooled by subtle, imperceptible changes to the input images. To address this vulnerability, adversarial training creates perturbation patterns and includes them in the training set to robustify the model. In contrast to existing adversarial training methods that only use class-boundary information (e.g., using a cross entropy loss), we propose to exploit additional information from the feature space to craft stronger adversaries that are in turn used to learn a robust model. Specifically, we use the style and content information of the target sample from another class, alongside its class boundary information to create adversarial perturbations. We apply our proposed multi-task objective in a deeply supervised manner, extracting multi-scale feature knowledge to create maximally separating adversaries. Subsequently, we propose a max-margin adversarial training approach that minimizes the distance between source image and its adversary and maximizes the distance between the adversary and the target image. Our adversarial training approach demonstrates strong robustness compared to state of the art defenses, generalizes well to naturally occurring corruptions and data distributional shifts, and retains the model accuracy on clean examples.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Anomaly Detection in Unsupervised Surveillance Setting Using Ensemble of Multimodal Data with Adversarial Defense',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'Autonomous aerial surveillance using drone feed is an interesting and challenging research domain. To ensure safety from intruders and potential objects posing threats to the zone being protected, it is crucial to be able to distinguish between normal and abnormal states in real-time. Additionally, we also need to consider any device malfunction. However, the inherent uncertainty embedded within the type and level of abnormality makes supervised techniques less suitable since the adversary may present a unique anomaly for intrusion. As a result, an unsupervised method for anomaly detection is preferable taking the unpredictable nature of attacks into account. Again in our case, the autonomous drone provides heterogeneous data streams consisting of images and other analog or digital sensor data, all of which can play a role in anomaly detection if they are ensembled synergistically. To that end, an ensemble detection mechanism is proposed here which estimates the degree of abnormality of analyzing the real-time image and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor data in an unsupervised manner. First, we have implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) regression block, named AngleNet to estimate the angle between a reference image and current test image, which provides us with a measure of the anomaly of the device. Moreover, the IMU data are used in autoencoders to predict abnormality. Finally, the results from these two pipelines are ensembled to estimate the final degree of abnormality. Furthermore, we have applied adversarial attack to test the robustness and security of the proposed approach and integrated defense mechanism. The proposed method performs satisfactorily on the IEEE SP Cup-2020 dataset with an accuracy of 97.8%. Additionally, we have also tested this approach on an in-house dataset to validate its robustness.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Deep Neural Networks are well known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks and backdoor attacks, where minor modifications on the input can mislead the models to give wrong results. Although defenses against adversarial attacks have been widely studied, research on mitigating backdoor attacks is still at an early stage. It is unknown whether there are any connections and common characteristics between the defenses against these two attacks. In this paper, we present a unified framework for detecting malicious examples and protecting the inference results of Deep Learning models. This framework is based on our observation that both adversarial examples and backdoor examples have anomalies during the inference process, highly distinguishable from benign samples. As a result, we repurpose and revise four existing adversarial defense methods for detecting backdoor examples. Extensive evaluations indicate these approaches provide reliable protection against backdoor attacks, with a higher accuracy than detecting adversarial examples. These solutions also reveal the relations of adversarial examples, backdoor examples and normal samples in model sensitivity, activation space and feature space. This can enhance our understanding about the inherent features of these two attacks, as well as the defense opportunities.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Medical imaging AI systems such as disease classification and segmentation are increasingly inspired and transformed from computer vision based AI systems. Although an array of adversarial training and/or loss function based defense techniques have been developed and proved to be effective in computer vision, defending against adversarial attacks on medical images remains largely an uncharted territory due to the following unique challenges: 1) label scarcity in medical images significantly limits adversarial generalizability of the AI system; 2) vastly similar and dominant fore- and background in medical images make it hard samples for learning the discriminating features between different disease classes; and 3) crafted adversarial noises added to the entire medical image as opposed to the focused organ target can make clean and adversarial examples more discriminate than that between different disease classes. In this paper, we propose a novel robust medical imaging AI framework based on Semi-Supervised Adversarial Training (SSAT) and Unsupervised Adversarial Detection (UAD), followed by designing a new measure for assessing systems adversarial risk. We systematically demonstrate the advantages of our robust medical imaging AI system over the existing adversarial defense techniques under diverse real-world settings of adversarial attacks using a benchmark OCT imaging data set.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A key challenge in adversarial robustness is the lack of a precise mathematical characterization of human perception, used in the very definition of adversarial attacks that are imperceptible to human eyes. Most current attacks and defenses try to avoid this issue by considering restrictive adversarial threat models such as those bounded by $L_2$ or $L_\\\\infty$ distance, spatial perturbations, etc. However, models that are robust against any of these restrictive threat models are still fragile against other threat models. To resolve this issue, we propose adversarial training against the set of all imperceptible adversarial examples, approximated using deep neural networks. We call this threat model the neural perceptual threat model (NPTM); it includes adversarial examples with a bounded neural perceptual distance (a neural network-based approximation of the true perceptual distance) to natural images. Through an extensive perceptual study, we show that the neural perceptual distance correlates well with human judgements of perceptibility of adversarial examples, validating our threat model. Under the NPTM, we develop novel perceptual adversarial attacks and defenses. Because the NPTM is very broad, we find that Perceptual Adversarial Training (PAT) against a perceptual attack gives robustness against many other types of adversarial attacks. We test PAT on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 against five diverse adversarial attacks. We find that PAT achieves state-of-the-art robustness against the union of these five attacks, more than doubling the accuracy over the next best model, without training against any of them. That is, PAT generalizes well to unforeseen perturbation types. This is vital in sensitive applications where a particular threat model cannot be assumed, and to the best of our knowledge, PAT is the first adversarial defense with this property.',\n",

Given a deep neural network (DNN) for a classification problem, an application of MAD optimization results in MadNet, a version of the original network, now equipped with an adversarial defense mechanism.

Our novel white-box defense tricks untargeted attacks into becoming attacks targeted at designated target classes. From these target classes, we can derive the real classes. Our Target Training defense tricks the minimization at the core of untargeted, gradient-based adversarial attacks: minimize the sum of (1) perturbation and (2) classifier adversarial loss. Target Training changes the classifier minimally, and trains it with additional duplicated points (at 0 distance) labeled with designated classes. These differently-labeled duplicated samples minimize both terms (1) and (2) of the minimization, steering attack convergence to samples of designated classes, from which correct classification is derived. Importantly, Target Training eliminates the need to know the attack and the overhead of generating adversarial samples of attacks that minimize perturbations. We obtain an 86.2% accuracy for CW-L2 (confidence=0) in CIFAR10, exceeding even unsecured classifier accuracy on non-adversarial samples.

       "  'abstract': \"The vulnerability of deep networks to adversarial attacks is a central problem for deep learning from the perspective of both cognition and security. The current most successful defense method is to train a classifier using adversarial images created during learning. Another defense approach involves transformation or purification of the original input to remove adversarial signals before the image is classified. We focus on defending naturally-trained classifiers using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with an Energy-Based Model (EBM) for adversarial purification. In contrast to adversarial training, our approach is intended to secure pre-existing and highly vulnerable classifiers. The memoryless behavior of long-run MCMC sampling will eventually remove adversarial signals, while metastable behavior preserves consistent appearance of MCMC samples after many steps to allow accurate long-run prediction. Balancing these factors can lead to effective purification and robust classification. We evaluate adversarial defense with an EBM using the strongest known attacks against purification. Our contributions are 1) an improved method for training EBM's with realistic long-run MCMC samples, 2) an Expectation-Over-Transformation (EOT) defense that resolves theoretical ambiguities for stochastic defenses and from which the EOT attack naturally follows, and 3) state-of-the-art adversarial defense for naturally-trained classifiers and competitive defense compared to adversarially-trained classifiers on Cifar-10, SVHN, and Cifar-100.

       "  'abstract': 'Recent works have demonstrated convolutional neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., inputs to machine learning models that an attacker has intentionally designed to cause the models to make a mistake. To improve the adversarial robustness of neural networks, adversarial training has been proposed to train networks by injecting adversarial examples into the training data. However, adversarial training could overfit to a specific type of adversarial attack and also lead to standard accuracy drop on clean images. To this end, we propose a novel Class-Aware Domain Adaptation (CADA) method for adversarial defense without directly applying adversarial training. Specifically, we propose to learn domain-invariant features for adversarial examples and clean images via a domain discriminator.

       "  'abstract': \"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are finding important applications in safety-critical systems such as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), where perceiving the environment correctly and robustly is necessary for safe operation. Raising unique challenges for assurance due to their black-box nature, DNNs pose a fundamental problem for regulatory acceptance of these types of systems. Robust training --- training to minimize excessive sensitivity to small changes in input --- has emerged as one promising technique to address this challenge. However, existing robust training tools are inconvenient to use or apply to existing codebases and models: they typically only support a small subset of model elements and require users to extensively rewrite the training code. In this paper we introduce a novel framework, PaRoT, developed on the popular TensorFlow platform, that greatly reduces the barrier to entry. Our framework enables robust training to be performed on arbitrary DNNs without any rewrites to the model. We demonstrate that our framework's performance is comparable to prior art, and exemplify its ease of use on off-the-shelf, trained models and its testing capabilities on a real-world industrial application: a traffic light detection network.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"It has been shown that the majority of existing adversarial defense methods achieve robustness at the cost of sacrificing prediction accuracy. The undesirable severe drop in accuracy adversely affects the reliability of machine learning algorithms and prohibits their deployment in realistic applications. This paper aims to address this dilemma by proposing a novel preprocessing framework, which we term Robust and Accurate Image classificatioN(RAIN), to improve the robustness of given CNN classifiers and, at the same time, preserve their high prediction accuracies. RAIN introduces a new randomization-enhancement scheme. It applies randomization over inputs to break the ties between the model forward prediction path and the backward gradient path, thus improving the model robustness. However, similar to existing preprocessing-based methods, the randomized process will degrade the prediction accuracy. To understand why this is the case, we compare the difference between original and processed images, and find it is the loss of high-frequency components in the input image that leads to accuracy drop of the classifier. Based on this finding, RAIN enhances the input's high-frequency details to retain the CNN's high prediction accuracy. Concretely, RAIN consists of two novel randomization modules: randomized small circular shift (RdmSCS) and randomized down-upsampling (RdmDU). The RdmDU module randomly downsamples the input image, and then the RdmSCS module circularly shifts the input image along a randomly chosen direction by a small but random number of pixels. Finally, the RdmDU module performs upsampling with a detail-enhancement model, such as deep super-resolution networks. We conduct extensive experiments on the STL10 and ImageNet datasets to verify the effectiveness of RAIN against various types of adversarial attacks.\",\n",

Our proposed PatchAttack is query efficient and can break models for both targeted and non-targeted attacks. PatchAttack induces misclassifications by superimposing small textured patches on the input image. We parametrize the appearance of these patches by a dictionary of class-specific textures. This texture dictionary is learned by clustering Gram matrices of feature activations from a VGG backbone. PatchAttack optimizes the position and texture parameters of each patch using reinforcement learning. Our experiments show that PatchAttack achieves > 99% success rate on ImageNet for a wide range of architectures, while only manipulating 3% of the image for non-targeted attacks and 10% on average for targeted attacks.

       "  'abstract': 'Adversarial examples have been shown to be the severe threat to deep neural networks (DNNs). One of the most effective adversarial defense methods is adversarial training (AT) through minimizing the adversarial risk $R_{adv}$, which encourages both the benign example $x$ and its adversarially perturbed neighborhoods within the $\\\\ell_{p}$-ball to be predicted as the ground-truth label. In this work, we propose a novel defense method, the robust training (RT), by jointly minimizing two separated risks ($R_{stand}$ and $R_{rob}$), which is with respect to the benign example and its neighborhoods respectively. The motivation is to explicitly and jointly enhance the accuracy and the adversarial robustness. We prove that $R_{adv}$ is upper-bounded by $R_{stand} + R_{rob}$, which implies that RT has similar effect as AT. Intuitively, minimizing the standard risk enforces the benign example to be correctly predicted, and the robust risk minimization encourages the predictions of the neighbor examples to be consistent with the prediction of the benign example. Besides, since $R_{rob}$ is independent of the ground-truth label, RT is naturally extended to the semi-supervised mode ($i.e.$, SRT), to further enhance the adversarial robustness. Moreover, we extend the $\\\\ell_{p}$-bounded neighborhood to a general case, which covers different types of perturbations, such as the pixel-wise ($i.e.$, $x + \\\\delta$) or the spatial perturbation ($i.e.$, $ AX + b$). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets not only verify the superiority of the proposed SRT method to state-of-the-art methods for defensing pixel-wise or spatial perturbations separately, but also demonstrate its robustness to both perturbations simultaneously.

       "  'abstract': 'While deep neural networks have been achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide variety of applications, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks limits their widespread deployment for safety-critical applications. Alongside other adversarial defense approaches being investigated, there has been a very recent interest in improving adversarial robustness in deep neural networks through the introduction of perturbations during the training process. However, such methods leverage fixed, pre-defined perturbations and require significant hyper-parameter tuning that makes them very difficult to leverage in a general fashion. In this study, we introduce Learn2Perturb, an end-to-end feature perturbation learning approach for improving the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks. More specifically, we introduce novel perturbation-injection modules that are incorporated at each layer to perturb the feature space and increase uncertainty in the network. This feature perturbation is performed at both the training and the inference stages. Furthermore, inspired by the Expectation-Maximization, an alternating back-propagation training algorithm is introduced to train the network and noise parameters consecutively. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets show that the proposed Learn2Perturb method can result in deep neural networks which are $4-7\\\\%$ more robust on $l_{\\\\infty}$ FGSM and PDG adversarial attacks and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art against $l_2$ $C\\\\&W$ attack and a wide range of well-known black-box attacks.',\n",

Current methods of defense from such attacks are based on either implicit or explicit regularization, e.g., adversarial training. Randomized smoothing, the averaging of the classifier outputs over a random distribution centered in the sample, has been shown to guarantee the performance of a classifier subject to bounded perturbations of the input. In this work, we study the application of randomized smoothing as a way to improve performance on unperturbed data as well as to increase robustness to adversarial attacks. The proposed technique can be applied on top of any existing adversarial defense, but works particularly well with the randomized approaches. We examine its performance on common white-box (PGD) and black-box (transfer and NAttack) attacks on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, substantially outperforming previous art for most scenarios and comparable on others. For example, we achieve 60.4% accuracy under a PGD attack on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-20, outperforming previous art by 11.7%. Since our method is based on sampling, it lends itself well for trading-off between the model inference complexity and its performance.

       "  'title': 'MimicGAN: Robust Projection onto Image Manifolds with Corruption Mimicking',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'In the past few years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have dramatically advanced our ability to represent and parameterize high-dimensional, non-linear image manifolds. As a result, they have been widely adopted across a variety of applications, ranging from challenging inverse problems like image completion, to problems such as anomaly detection and adversarial defense. A recurring theme in many of these applications is the notion of projecting an image observation onto the manifold that is inferred by the generator. In this context, Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) has been the most popular approach, which essentially optimizes for a latent vector that minimizes the discrepancy between a generated image and the given observation. However, PGD is a brittle optimization technique that fails to identify the right projection (or latent vector) when the observation is corrupted, or perturbed even by a small amount. Such corruptions are common in the real world, for example images in the wild come with unknown crops, rotations, missing pixels, or other kinds of non-linear distributional shifts which break current encoding methods, rendering downstream applications unusable. To address this, we propose corruption mimicking -- a new robust projection technique, that utilizes a surrogate network to approximate the unknown corruption directly at test time, without the need for additional supervision or data augmentation. The proposed method is significantly more robust than PGD and other competing methods under a wide variety of corruptions, thereby enabling a more effective use of GANs in real-world applications. More importantly, we show that our approach produces state-of-the-art performance in several GAN-based applications -- anomaly detection, domain adaptation, and adversarial defense, that benefit from an accurate projection.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'We propose a simple yet effective method to reduce the redundancy of DenseNet by substantially decreasing the number of stacked modules by replacing the original bottleneck by our SMG module, which is augmented by local residual. Furthermore, SMG module is equipped with an efficient two-stage pipeline, which aims to DenseNet-like architectures that need to integrate all previous outputs, i.e., squeezing the incoming informative but redundant features gradually by hierarchical convolutions as a hourglass shape and then exciting it by multi-kernel depthwise convolutions, the output of which would be compact and hold more informative multi-scale features. We further develop a forget and an update gate by introducing the popular attention modules to implement the effective fusion instead of a simple addition between reused and new features. Due to the Hybrid Connectivity (nested combination of global dense and local residual) and Gated mechanisms, we called our network as the HCGNet. Experimental results on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets show that HCGNet is more prominently efficient than DenseNet, and can also significantly outperform state-of-the-art networks with less complexity. Moreover, HCGNet also shows the remarkable interpretability and robustness by network dissection and adversarial defense, respectively. On MS-COCO, HCGNet can consistently learn better features than popular backbones.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Defensive Few-shot Adversarial Learning',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'The robustness of deep learning models against adversarial attacks has received increasing attention in recent years. However, both deep learning and adversarial training rely on the availability of a large amount of labeled data and usually do not generalize well to new, unseen classes when only a few training samples are accessible. To address this problem, we explicitly introduce a new challenging problem -- how to learn a robust deep model with limited training samples per class, called defensive few-shot learning in this paper. Simply employing the existing adversarial training techniques in the literature cannot solve this problem. This is because few-shot learning needs to learn transferable knowledge from disjoint auxiliary data, and thus it is invalid to assume the sample-level distribution consistency between the training and test sets as commonly assumed in existing adversarial training techniques. In this paper, instead of assuming such a distribution consistency, we propose to make this assumption at a task-level in the episodic training paradigm in order to better transfer the defense knowledge. Furthermore, inside each task, we design a task-conditioned distribution constraint to narrow the distribution gap between clean and adversarial examples at a sample-level. These give rise to a novel mechanism called multi-level distribution based adversarial training (MDAT) for learning transferable adversarial defense. In addition, a unified $\\\\mathcal{F}_{\\\\beta}$ score is introduced to evaluate different defense methods under the same principle. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDAT achieves higher effectiveness and robustness over existing alternatives in the few-shot case.',\n",

In this paper, we propose a fundamentally different approach which instead changes the way the output is represented and decoded. This simple approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness to adversarial examples for L 2 and L ∞ based adversarial perturbations on MNIST and CIFAR10. In addition, even under strong white-box attacks, we find that our model often assigns adversarial examples a low probability; those with high probability are usually interpretable, i.e. perturbed towards the perceptual boundary between the original and adversarial class. Our approach has several advantages: it yields more meaningful probability estimates, is extremely fast during training and testing, requires essentially no architectural changes to existing discriminative learning pipelines, is wholly complementary to other defense approaches including adversarial training, and does not sacrifice benign test set performance',\n",

In particular, we can observe a severe performance degradation by slightly changing the graph adjacency matrix or the features of a few nodes, making it unsuitable for security-critical applications. Inspired by the previous works on adversarial defense for deep neural networks, and especially adversarial training algorithm, we propose a method called GraphDefense to defend against the adversarial perturbations. In addition, for our defense method, we could still maintain semi-supervised learning settings, without a large label rate. We also show that adversarial training in features is equivalent to adversarial training for edges with a small perturbation.

Similar to other types of deep models, graph deep learning models often suffer from adversarial attacks. However, compared with non-graph data, the discrete features, graph connections and different definitions of imperceptible perturbations bring unique challenges and opportunities for the adversarial attacks and defenses for graph data. In this paper, we propose both attack and defense techniques. For attack, we show that the discreteness problem could easily be resolved by introducing integrated gradients which could accurately reflect the effect of perturbing certain features or edges while still benefiting from the parallel computations. For defense, we observe that the adversarially manipulated graph for the targeted attack differs from normal graphs statistically. Based on this observation, we propose a defense approach which inspects the graph and recovers the potential adversarial perturbations.

In this paper, we define the local flatness of the loss surface as the maximum value of the chosen norm of the gradient regarding to the input within a neighborhood centered on the benign sample, and discuss the relationship between the local flatness and adversarial vulnerability. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel defense approach via regularizing the local flatness, dubbed local flatness regularization (LFR).

While many techniques for detecting these attacks have been proposed, they are easily bypassed when the adversary has full knowledge of the detection mechanism and adapts the attack strategy accordingly. In this paper, we adopt a novel perspective and regard the omnipresence of adversarial perturbations as a strength rather than a weakness. We postulate that if an image has been tampered with, these adversarial directions either become harder to find with gradient methods or have substantially higher density than for natural images. We develop a practical test for this signature characteristic to successfully detect adversarial attacks, achieving unprecedented accuracy under the white-box setting where the adversary is given full knowledge of our detection mechanism.',\n",

Single-lead ECG can be embedded in medical devices and wearable products such as the injectable Medtronic Linq monitor, the iRhythm Ziopatch wearable monitor, and the Apple Watch Series 4. Recently, deep neural networks have been used to automatically analyze ECG tracings, outperforming even physicians specialized in cardiac electrophysiology in detecting certain rhythm irregularities. However, deep learning classifiers have been shown to be brittle to adversarial examples, which are examples created to look incontrovertibly belonging to a certain class to a human eye but contain subtle features that fool the classifier into misclassifying them into the wrong class. Very recently, adversarial examples have also been created for medical-related tasks. Yet, traditional attack methods to create adversarial examples, such as projected gradient descent (PGD) do not extend directly to ECG signals, as they generate examples that introduce square wave artifacts that are not physiologically plausible. Here, we developed a method to construct smoothed adversarial examples for single-lead ECG. First, we implemented a neural network model achieving state-of-the-art performance on the data from the 2017 PhysioNet/Computing-in-Cardiology Challenge for arrhythmia detection from single lead ECG classification. For this model, we utilized a new technique to generate smoothed examples to produce signals that are 1) indistinguishable to cardiologists from the original examples and 2) incorrectly classified by the neural network. Finally, we show that adversarial examples are not unique and provide a general technique to collate and perturb known adversarial examples to create new ones.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In practice, deep neural networks have been found to be vulnerable to various types of noise, such as adversarial examples and corruption. Various adversarial defense methods have accordingly been developed to improve adversarial robustness for deep models. However, simply training on data mixed with adversarial examples, most of these models still fail to defend against the generalized types of noise. Motivated by the fact that hidden layers play a highly important role in maintaining a robust model, this paper proposes a simple yet powerful training algorithm, named \\\\emph{Adversarial Noise Propagation} (ANP), which injects noise into the hidden layers in a layer-wise manner. ANP can be implemented efficiently by exploiting the nature of the backward-forward training style. Through thorough investigations, we determine that different hidden layers make different contributions to model robustness and clean accuracy, while shallow layers are comparatively more critical than deep layers. Moreover, our framework can be easily combined with other adversarial training methods to further improve model robustness by exploiting the potential of hidden layers. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-10-P, and ImageNet demonstrate that ANP enables the strong robustness for deep models against both adversarial and corrupted ones, and also significantly outperforms various adversarial defense methods.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Natural Language Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in Word Level',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'In recent years, inspired by a mass of researches on adversarial examples for computer vision, there has been a growing interest in designing adversarial attacks for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, followed by very few works of adversarial defenses for NLP. To our knowledge, there exists no defense method against the successful synonym substitution based attacks that aim to satisfy all the lexical, grammatical, semantic constraints and thus are hard to be perceived by humans. We contribute to fill this gap and propose a novel adversarial defense method called \\\\textit{Synonym Encoding Method} (SEM), which inserts an encoder before the input layer of the model and then trains the model to eliminate adversarial perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEM can efficiently defend current best synonym substitution based adversarial attacks with little decay on the accuracy for benign examples. To better evaluate SEM, we also design a strong attack method called Improved Genetic Algorithm (IGA) that adopts the genetic metaheuristic for synonym substitution based attacks. Compared with the first genetic based adversarial attack proposed in 2018, IGA can achieve higher attack success rate with lower word substitution rate, at the same time maintain the transferability of adversarial examples.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Defending Against Adversarial Attacks by Suppressing the Largest Eigenvalue of Fisher Information Matrix',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'We propose a scheme for defending against adversarial attacks by suppressing the largest eigenvalue of the Fisher information matrix (FIM). Our starting point is one explanation on the rationale of adversarial examples. Based on the idea of the difference between a benign sample and its adversarial example is measured by the Euclidean norm, while the difference between their classification probability densities at the last (softmax) layer of the network could be measured by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, the explanation shows that the output difference is a quadratic form of the input difference. If the eigenvalue of this quadratic form (a.k.a. FIM) is large, the output difference becomes large even when the input difference is small, which explains the adversarial phenomenon. This makes the adversarial defense possible by controlling the eigenvalues of the FIM. Our solution is adding one term representing the trace of the FIM to the loss function of the original network, as the largest eigenvalue is bounded by the trace. Our defensive scheme is verified by experiments using a variety of common attacking methods on typical deep neural networks, e.g. LeNet, VGG and ResNet, with datasets MNIST, CIFAR-10, and German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB). Our new network, after adopting the novel loss function and retraining, has an effective and robust defensive capability, as it decreases the fooling ratio of the generated adversarial examples, and remains the classification accuracy of the original network.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this paper, we study the problem of how to defend classifiers against adversarial attacks that fool the classifiers using subtly modified input data. In contrast to previous works, here we focus on the white-box adversarial defense where the attackers are granted full access to not only the classifiers but also defenders to produce as strong attacks as possible. In such a context we propose viewing a defender as a functional, a higher-order function that takes functions as its argument to represent a function space, rather than fixed functions conventionally. From this perspective, a defender should be realized and optimized individually for each adversarial input. To this end, we propose RIDE, an efficient and provably convergent self-supervised learning algorithm for individual data estimation to protect the predictions from adversarial attacks. We demonstrate the significant improvement of adversarial defense performance on image recognition, eg, 98%, 76%, 43% test accuracy on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets respectively under the state-of-the-art BPDA attacker.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Adversarial machine learning is a well-studied field of research where an adversary causes predictable errors in a machine learning algorithm through precise manipulation of the input. Numerous techniques have been proposed to harden machine learning algorithms and mitigate the effect of adversarial attacks. Of these techniques, adversarial training, which augments the training data with adversarial samples, has proven to be an effective defense with respect to a certain class of attacks. However, adversarial training is computationally expensive and its improvements are limited to a single model. In this work, we take a first step toward creating a model-agnostic adversarial defense. We propose Adversarially-Trained Autoencoder Augmentation (AAA), the first model-agnostic adversarial defense that is robust against certain adaptive adversaries. We show that AAA allows us to achieve a partially model-agnostic defense by training a single autoencoder to protect multiple pre-trained classifiers; achieving adversarial performance on par or better than adversarial training without modifying the classifiers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AAA can be used to create a fully model-agnostic defense for MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets by improving the adversarial performance of a never before seen pre-trained classifier by at least 45% with no additional training. Finally, using a natural image corruption dataset, we show that our approach improves robustness to naturally corrupted images,which has been identified as strongly indicative of true adversarial robustness.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Most existing adversarial defenses only measure robustness to L_p adversarial attacks. Not only are adversaries unlikely to exclusively create small L_p perturbations, adversaries are unlikely to remain fixed. Adversaries adapt and evolve their attacks; hence adversarial defenses must be robust to a broad range of unforeseen attacks. We address this discrepancy between research and reality by proposing a new evaluation framework called ImageNet-UA. Our framework enables the research community to test ImageNet model robustness against attacks not encountered during training. To create ImageNet-UA's diverse attack suite, we introduce a total of four novel adversarial attacks. We also demonstrate that, in comparison to ImageNet-UA, prevailing L_inf robustness assessments give a narrow account of model robustness. By evaluating current defenses with ImageNet-UA, we find they provide little robustness to unforeseen attacks. We hope the greater variety and realism of ImageNet-UA enables development of more robust defenses which can generalize beyond attacks seen during training.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Adversarial robustness has emerged as an important topic in deep learning as carefully crafted attack samples can significantly disturb the performance of a model. Many recent methods have proposed to improve adversarial robustness by utilizing adversarial training or model distillation, which adds additional procedures to model training. In this paper, we propose a new training paradigm called Guided Complement Entropy (GCE) that is capable of achieving \"adversarial defense for free,\" which involves no additional procedures in the process of improving adversarial robustness. In addition to maximizing model probabilities on the ground-truth class like cross-entropy, we neutralize its probabilities on the incorrect classes along with a \"guided\" term to balance between these two terms. We show in the experiments that our method achieves better model robustness with even better performance compared to the commonly used cross-entropy training objective. We also show that our method can be used orthogonal to adversarial training across well-known methods with noticeable robustness gain. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first one that improves model robustness without compromising performance.',\n",
